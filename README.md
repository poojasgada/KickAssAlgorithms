KickAssAlgorithms
=================

This repo contains some of the super cool algorithms which i implemented in Python <br>

I try to maintain them in the form of a library, but sometimes i get lazy :-) <br> 

If there is anything you want me to implement or improve, please feel free to leave a comment <br>

Currently this repo contains: <br><br>
<ul>
<li>
Library containing methods for all Binary search operations such as<br><br>
a. Insertions<br>
b. Traversals - Inorder, Postorder, Preorder <br>
c. Searching <br>

Todo:<br>
a. Deletions in BST<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
Graph traversals and operations using Adjacency Lists<br><br>
a. Breadth first search - iterative<br>
b. Shortest Path using Breadth First Search <br>
c. Depth First Search - iterative and recursive<br>
</li>
<br>
<li>
3. Finding Needle in the Haystack using Boyer Moore algorithm<br>
</li>
</ul>
